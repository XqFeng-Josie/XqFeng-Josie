- 👋 Hi, xiaoqin is me!! My biggest motivation is using the world’s multi-modal information to improve our lives.
- 🌱 I’m  a Senior Speech Algorithm Engineer at Mobvoi AI Lab.
- 👀  My working area is text-to-speech(TTS), in which I primarily
focus on NLP(TN/G2P/Prosody/Stress/Style/Emotion), model optimization(NLP/TTS), Emotional TTS, and online server application,
all of this based on cross-lingual(English, Mandarin, etc.).
- 💞️ I’m applying Ph.D. in NLP/knowledge/Speech/Data, my research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), knowledge acquisition, and representation, and I have great inspiration for the world's information network.
